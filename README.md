# webcrawl
This is a python program that can crawl Chinese tang poetry from the Internet.

This is the simplest web crawler, from the beginning of the page, get links, and then enter the link to crawl different network resources.A tang poem will be stored in a TXT file in the desired path folder.

The file_path should be changed.

The purpose of this program is to provide data sets for my RNN program later.
